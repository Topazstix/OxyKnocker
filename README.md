# OxyKnocker (Open Up)

Inspiration for this tool was taken from [knock](https://github.com/grongor/knock/). Decided to try and re-write a few python programs in the oxidized :crab: way. This one was first!

## Usage

```rust

cargo run <options> [IP] [PORTS]
```

## WORK IN PROGRESS

At current, several features are not working correctly or at all. Multiple ports are not being read correctly, and there is a problem with parsing the timeout and delay variables, so I've disabled them until i fix them.
